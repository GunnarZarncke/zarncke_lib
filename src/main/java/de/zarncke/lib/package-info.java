/**
 * The Zarncke Library contains general and generic code for many programming problems.
 * Topics of interest include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link de.zarncke.lib.ctx} providing a type-save and clean
 * {@link de.zarncke.lib.ctx.Context} for implicit parameters.</li>
 * <li>{@link de.zarncke.lib.err} providing a {@link de.zarncke.lib.err.Warden} for
 * clean and simple Exception handling.</li>
 * <li>{@link de.zarncke.lib.id} providing  {@link de.zarncke.lib.id.Gid generic IDs} for
 * type-save ID handling together with some support for {@link de.zarncke.lib.id.Resolving} them.</li>
 * <li>{@link de.zarncke.lib.store} providing a generalize {@link de.zarncke.lib.io.store.Store} abstraction.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Yes, I know, there are lots of other libraries of this kind.
 * Much of this you will have seen elsewhere too.
 * I do not claim that this is the best, nor even a very good one.
 * It just contains the programming patterns I came across and couldn't find (at that time) on the web.
 * Use it or don't use it. But understand it if you use my projects.
